# About This Project

During my time at Cisco, I had the opportunity to build from the ground up a tool that integrated with their TAC support ticketing system, as well as a few other sources.

Since it was code I wrote at the time for Cisco, I cannot simply copy/paste the old code. Why?
1. I no longer work there.
2. Even if I did, it would likely be against corporate policy to put that code elsewhere publicly.
3. The data I once had access to, I no longer do.

So instead, I am going to recreate what I can from memory!

Please review the [docs](/docs) to see what this code currently does & how information is utilized.
